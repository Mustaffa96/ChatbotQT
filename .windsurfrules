1. Writing Clean Code for PyQt
a. Follow PEP 8 and Python Naming Conventions
Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables (e.g., MainWindow, update_label, user_input).
Class names: Use CamelCase for PyQt widget classes (e.g., CustomDialog).
Functions and variables: Use snake_case (e.g., calculate_total, button_clicked).
Limit line length to 79–88 characters for readability (per PEP 8).
Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
b. Organize Code into Classes and Modules
Use classes for widgets: Encapsulate PyQt widgets (e.g., QMainWindow, QDialog) in classes to group related functionality.
Split code into modules
c. Use Qt Designer for UI Layouts
Design UI layouts with Qt Designer to create .ui files, then convert them to Python code using pyuic5
Don’t modify generated UI code: Instead, subclass the generated UI class to add logic
d. Handle Signals and Slots Cleanly
Use new-style signal-slot syntax for clarity and type safety
Avoid lambda functions unless necessary, as they can obscure intent
Group signal-slot connections in a dedicated method (e.g., connect_signals)
e. Keep UI and Logic Separate
Follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern or similar:
View: PyQt widgets (UI).
Model: Data structures or database logic.
Controller: Mediates between view and model.
f. Use Type Hints and Docstrings
Add type hints for better code clarity and IDE support:
Write concise docstrings for classes, methods, and functions to explain their purpose.
g. Handle Resources Properly
Use Qt Resource System (pyrcc5) for managing images, icons, etc.
Import resources in your code

2. Optimizing PyQt Code
Optimization focuses on reducing memory usage, improving responsiveness, and minimizing CPU load.
a. Minimize Widget Creation
Reuse widgets instead of creating new ones repeatedly:
b. Use Layouts for Dynamic UI
Use QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, or QGridLayout instead of fixed positions to handle resizing and dynamic content efficiently.
c. Optimize Signal Handling
Disconnect signals when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks:
Use QSignalBlocker to temporarily block signals during batch updates
d. Use QThread for Long-Running Tasks
Move heavy computations to a QThread to keep the UI responsive
e. Cache Expensive Operations
Cache results of expensive computations or database queries
f. Use QTimer for Periodic Tasks
Use QTimer instead of loops for periodic updates
